## What is Snake?
This repository is a small version of Snake that I created to put into practice the knowledge I acquired in the CPSC110 course by the University of British Columbia.

### Dependencies
- UBC's Racket installation of Dr. Racket (or equivalent).

## Installation and usage
You can use the project following these steps:
1. Download "racket.rkt".
2. Open "racket.rkt" in Dr. Racket.
3. Run the file.
4. In the interactions area, run `(main (create-game DF-FOOD-NUM))`.
  - This sets the amount of food in the game to the default (3). To play with, say, 5 pieces of food, run `(main (create-game 5))` instead.
